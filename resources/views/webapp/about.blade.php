                <p>Thank you for visiting Food Bank.
                    Foodbank is a non-profit mission that promotes and encourages
                    food sharing activities in order to reduce food waste in the
                    community and to serve as a connection between the compassion 
                    of our donors and the needs of our recipients.
                    We transform your compassion into hope for people all across the 
                    world.Â The app also informs heroes about the nonprofit's work,
                    goal, and effect. The software is aimed towards anyone 
                    who wishes to contribute or receive food. Foodbank views hunger as 
                    a logistical issue rather than a scarcity.</p>
